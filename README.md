#BCB546X_Final_Project
The microsatellite_geno_pop.txt is the microsatellite data in genepop format. I had to adjust bits by hand so don't mess with that file or I'llhave to retype stuff.
The microsatellite_genepop_data.xls is the file that I had to go in and edit by hand to bring in and make the geno_pop.txt
The Microsatellite genotype data.xlsx now has a ton of sheets with the Genalex analysis stuff.
