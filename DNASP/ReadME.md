﻿# DNAsp ( Polymorphism indices of the mtCOI sequences were calculated using this software )##Jose Lopez###Read the files using git ###Download [DNASP](http://www.ub.edu/dnasp/) <-- downloadGene pop data was used to generate the outputs.DNA Sequence Polymorphism was able to produce the  number of haplotypes (K),  the number of segregating sites (S), nucleotide diversity (p) and haplotype diversity (Hd). This was all displayed on tabular and graphic form.- .out Text files have been created - Use cat function in unix to look at the data for table 3, Create the table using excel. - I was unable to create the number individuals from table 3 ### steps1. Add the genepop file created using the input data buton1. separate the sites using the analyze imput( you have to know how many snps are in each site)1.  create the file by saving it ( this program saves the files in.out)1.  use unix to read the file and separate it in an excel file using the cat command
