#GenAlEx

GenAlEx stands for Genetic Analysis in Excel. It is an excel add in for population genetic analysis.

##Data
Data was generated from the raw data file, 'Microsatellite genotype data.xlsx', which was already in GenAlEx format.
All data generated during the analysis is automatically saved as sheets in the excel workbook, and has been saved under 'microsatellite_genotype_genalex.xlsx'.

##Analysis
The analysis was done by working through the GenAlEx tutorials, published on the GenAlEx website, which are saved in the GenAlEx_tutorials folder.
