##Figure 4

The figure was generated using an open-source software called STRUCTURE. There have been many problems encountered with recreating this figure. 

###Problems:
- The software they used is not user friendly, especially compared to what we are used to today. Installing it was quite an adventure and took longer and more googling than I care to admit.
- A more up to date version of STRUCTURE was easier to download and install; however, this isn't the version they used in creating the figure, which could be a problem.
- However, the biggest problem I encountered: data format. The program is very rigid in the data format it requires to properly load and run. The authors don't designate what data manipulation they have performed on the raw data to prepare it for analysis in STRUCTURE. 
The STRUCTURE documentation is decent but lacks in some vital areas such as what should the data look like to the program, not to us. However, the vast wealth of knowledge came from their google help page. This is where I stumbled onto a forum page that said one of the major issues they encounter is when data is created on a PC machine and an OSX or Linux user downloads it. The formatting becomes very messed up and the program can't read it. That sounds like what I encountered! I then tried to see if I could create one line of the data in a new document by typing it out, not by copying it. I found on one of the forum pages that there needs to be tabs within the rows and a return at the end of the row. I did this and the program was still reading the document as if there were way more rows and columns present. I was now back at square one with the same problem.
