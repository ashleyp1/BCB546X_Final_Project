##Figure 4

The figure was generated using an open-source software called STRUCTURE. There have been many problems encountered with recreating this figure. 

###Problems:
- They don't designate that STRUCTURE is an open-source software, I had to look up what STRUCTURE was and stumbled into that. 
- The software they used is not user friendly, especially compared to what we are used to today. Installing it was quite a pain and doesn't show up in my applications menu. 
- A more up to date version of STRUCTURE was easier to download and install but again, this isn't the version they used in creating the figure.
- The biggest problem I encountered: data format. The program is very specific in what it requires to properly do the analysis. The authors don't designate what data manipulation they have performed to get the data ready for the program.
